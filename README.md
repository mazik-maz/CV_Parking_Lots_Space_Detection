# Detection of Free Parking Spaces Using Computer Vision Techniques
In urban areas, parking space detection is a crucial task to alleviate traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of parking management systems. This project aims to detect free parking spaces in images from the PKLot dataset using traditional computer vision techniques without relying on deep learning methods

## Architecture

- parking_spaces.npy - file with coordinates of parking lots
- final_base - folder with templates of empty parking lots
- images - folder with another folders with images of parking
- markup - folder with markups of parking lots

- main.ipynb - main notebook with the latest and the most efficient solution
- template_matching.ipynb - notebook with template matching algorithm without coordinates of lots
- mathcing_with_features.ipynb - notebook with solution using sift features
